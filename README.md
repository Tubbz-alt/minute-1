## minute

One of many possibilities for a personal statistics dashboard. Currently
it works with [minute-agent](https://github.com/tmcw/minute-agent), my
Cocoa keycounter application to show off keystrokes. It's a work in progress.

Uses lots of [d3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) behind the scenes,
with just a quick hint of jQuery to tie things together.

Made to work without real configuration or setup. I symlink `~/log/` to
`~/Sites/log/`.
